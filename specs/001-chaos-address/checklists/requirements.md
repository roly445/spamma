# Specification Quality Checklist: Chaos Monkey Email Address (Chaos Address)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

- ## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

### Validation Findings

- All checklist items pass. The spec contains no remaining [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers.

### Next steps

1. Proceed to planning (e.g., `/speckit.plan`) to break this feature into implementation tasks, API definitions, UI work, and tests.
