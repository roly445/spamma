# CI/CD Implementation Checklist

Complete this checklist to fully activate the CI/CD pipelines for Spamma.

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Basic Setup (Immediate - No Deployment)

### Workflows Already Active
- [x] **ci-build-test.yml** - Runs on every push/PR to main/develop/feature/*
- [x] **ci-pr-checks.yml** - Runs on every PR
- [x] **ci-docker.yml** - Runs on push to main/develop

**Status:** All active immediately upon push to repository ‚úÖ

### Verification Steps
- [ ] Push feature branch to repository
- [ ] Verify GitHub Actions runs workflows (Actions tab)
- [ ] Check test results appear
- [ ] Verify coverage comment appears on PR

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: Docker Registry (Required for cd-deploy.yml)

### GitHub Container Registry Setup
- [x] Docker build workflow created
- [ ] Verify first Docker build completes (check Actions workflow)
- [ ] Image appears in `ghcr.io/[username]/spamma` (check Packages tab)

**Status:** Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` automatically (no manual secret needed)

### Verification Steps
- [ ] Trigger `ci-docker.yml` workflow manually or push to main
- [ ] Watch build complete
- [ ] Check image in GitHub Packages: Settings ‚Üí Packages ‚Üí Containers
- [ ] Note image tag (e.g., `sha-abc123` or `main-sha-...`)

---

## ‚è≥ Phase 3: Server Setup (Required for Deployment)

### Create SSH Key
```bash
# Run on local machine (or CI server if preferred)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/spamma_deploy -N ""

# Copy private key to clipboard (you'll need this for GitHub secret)
cat ~/.ssh/spamma_deploy | xclip  # Linux
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/spamma_deploy    # macOS
# Windows: Use Notepad or PowerShell
```

- [ ] SSH key pair generated (ed25519 format)
- [ ] Private key ready for GitHub secret
- [ ] Public key ready for server installation

### Configure Staging Server
```bash
# On staging server
ssh ubuntu@staging.example.com

# Create deployment user
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash deploy
sudo usermod -aG docker deploy

# Create deployment directory
sudo mkdir -p /opt/spamma
sudo chown deploy:deploy /opt/spamma

# Setup SSH key
sudo -u deploy mkdir -p /home/deploy/.ssh
echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5..." | sudo tee -a /home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo -u deploy chmod 700 /home/deploy/.ssh
sudo -u deploy chmod 600 /home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Verify Docker installed
docker --version && docker-compose --version
```

- [ ] Staging server accessible via SSH
- [ ] `deploy` user created with Docker access
- [ ] Public SSH key added to authorized_keys
- [ ] `/opt/spamma` directory owned by deploy user
- [ ] Docker and Docker Compose installed
- [ ] SSH login works: `ssh -i spamma_deploy deploy@staging.example.com`

### Configure Production Server
- [ ] Repeat staging server steps (with production hostname)
- [ ] Verify SSH access works
- [ ] Confirm Docker installed

---

## üîë Phase 4: GitHub Secrets Setup (Required for cd-deploy.yml)

### Add Secrets to GitHub

**Location:** GitHub Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions

### Secret 1: Deploy Key
- [ ] Copy private key content (from SSH key generation)
- [ ] Go to GitHub Secrets
- [ ] New secret: `DEPLOY_KEY`
- [ ] Paste private key content

### Secret 2: Staging Credentials
- [ ] New secret: `STAGING_DEPLOY_HOST`
  - Value: `staging.example.com` (or IP address)
- [ ] New secret: `STAGING_DEPLOY_USER`
  - Value: `deploy` (the SSH user)

### Secret 3: Production Credentials
- [ ] New secret: `PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_HOST`
  - Value: `prod.example.com` (or IP address)
- [ ] New secret: `PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_USER`
  - Value: `deploy` (the SSH user)

### Verification
```bash
# You should now have 5 secrets:
DEPLOY_KEY                    # SSH private key
STAGING_DEPLOY_HOST           # Staging server hostname
STAGING_DEPLOY_USER           # Staging SSH user
PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_HOST        # Production server hostname
PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_USER        # Production SSH user
```

- [ ] All 5 secrets appear in GitHub UI
- [ ] No typos in secret names
- [ ] Private key is complete (includes BEGIN and END markers)

    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${DB_USER:-spamma}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${DB_NAME:-spamma}
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    restart: unless-stopped

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    container_name: spamma-redis
    restart: unless-stopped

## üìù Notes

### Performance Tips
- Workflows cache npm and NuGet packages (~30% faster builds)
- Docker builds use layer caching (~50% faster on changes)
- Coverage reports generated only on test success
- Health checks retry 3 times before failing

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Workflow not triggering?**
- Check branch name (must be main/develop/feature/*)
- Check file has no YAML syntax errors
- Push another commit to trigger

**Coverage comment missing?**
- Tests must pass for report to generate
- Check artifact `test-results/` exists
- Verify ReportGenerator step completed

**Deployment failing?**
- Check secrets configured (5 required secrets)
- Verify server SSH access: `ssh -i key user@host`
- Check server has Docker and Docker Compose
- Review logs: GitHub Actions step output

**Docker image not pushing?**
- Only main branch pushes to registry
- Feature branches build locally only
- Verify GITHUB_TOKEN permissions

### Next Steps After Setup
1. ‚úÖ Commit docker-deployment/ directory
2. ‚úÖ Create PR with CI/CD changes
3. ‚úÖ Merge to main
4. ‚úÖ Monitor first automated workflows
5. ‚úÖ Deploy to staging
6. ‚úÖ Validate staging deployment
7. ‚úÖ Deploy to production
