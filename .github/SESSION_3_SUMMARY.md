## 🚀 What Works Right Now (No Setup)

✅ **Push to any branch** → Workflows automatically run
✅ **Create PR** → Quality checks run, labels applied
✅ **View coverage** → Automatic comment on PR with metrics
✅ **Monitor Docker** → Images build and push to registry
✅ **Check Security** → Trivy scans visible in Security tab

---

## ⏳ What Requires Setup (Optional)

⏳ **Deployment workflow** → Needs 5 GitHub secrets
⏳ **Staging environment** → Needs SSH key & server config
⏳ **Production deployment** → Needs docker-compose structure

**Estimated Setup Time:** 30-60 minutes (follow IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md)
